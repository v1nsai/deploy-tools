# wireguard

Wireguard is a fast, modern VPN protocol.  This project is designed to give quick access to servers on an internal openstack network directly from your dev machine. By default it will create 5 peers.  This can be changed by changing the `PEERS` variable in `projects/wireguard/docker-compose.yaml` before launching.

To deploy, set the network you want to connect to in `projects/wireguard/terraform/instance.tf`, then run:
`scripts/image-test.sh wireguard â€“dev`

Once it launches, you can download client config files from `/opt/deploy/wireguard/peerX` where X is the peer number.
