# Wordpress

Wordpress is a blogging platform meant to give full control to non-technical users.  The TechIG Wordpress project uses docker and Traefik to automate deploying secure, auto updating WordPress instances.

Copy the `projects/wordpress/terraform/wordpress.auto.tfvars.template` file to `projects/wordpress/terraform/wordpress.auto.tfvars` and fill in the variables.  It’s ok to leave the `url` variable blank if you just want to test with a self-signed certificate.

Deploy with:
`scripts/image-test.sh wordpress –dev`

To deploy using a custom wordpress image, make sure that the image name created in `projects/wordpress/packer/image.pkr.hcl` matches the image name in `projects/wordpress/terraform/instance.tf`, then run:
`scripts/image-test.sh wordpress –dev –rebuild`
