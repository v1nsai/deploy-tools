# nextcloud-helm

This project can be used to launch Nextcloud onto Kubernetes.  It does not require  that a Kubernetes cluster be provisioned already, it contains Terraform templates to deploy a cluster, configure access to it on your development machine, then deploys Nextcloud onto the cluster.

Deploy the cluster:
`scripts/image-test.sh nextcloud-helm â€“dev`

Then run the install script:
`projects/nextcloud-helm/install.sh`
